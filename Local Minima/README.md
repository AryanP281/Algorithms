Given a nxn grid of distinct numbers, finds a local minima. A number is a local minimum if it is smaller than all of its neighbors. 
(A neighbor of a number is one immediately above, below, to the left, or the right. 
Most numbers have four neighbors; numbers on the side have three; the four corners have two.)

T(n) = O(n)
